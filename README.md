# UK_Sales_Map

**Project Description:**


This visualization is tailored for a London-based retailer looking to grow their stores across the UK. It features a map that shows where the retailer's online orders are coming from, helping to spot the best cities for new stores. The map also highlights where the top three competitors are located to avoid stepping into highly competitive areas. Thereâ€™s a handy toggle in the top right corner of the map, so you can easily show or hide these competitors' locations, making it simpler to see where the next store could thrive.
